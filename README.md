# Epic
Epic is intended to be a story-based tabletop role-playing game that attempts
to leverage Joseph Campbell's monomyth framework, or The Hero's Journey.  The
rules and mechanics are being crafted in a way that incents the creation
and driving of a plot and story in the same manner that (I understand) a
novelist would write a story.

NB: Not yet playable.  Not yet alpha.  Not even coherent.  Watch this space.
